# TCP_Talker
A bi-directional TCP talker in Java using Sockets.

This project is made using IntelliJ Idea. I have build the jar files, but you can also run the program from code only.
This is a pretty basic program which demonstrates `One to One` connection between a ~single~ client and server.

Happy Coding ðŸ˜€
